      In this project we learned the basic movements of a robot and the logic used in Comp Sci.

      In our scratch game you are trying to avoid bullets. You have 3 lives and a timer keeps track of your time. 
      <br>
      The bullets spawn randomly throughout the grid.

      In this project we took blocks of code and created a playable app. For me and my partners app, we created a Duck Hunter game. In the
      <br>
      game a duck randomly moves on a plain and the player drags a tank with a drag bar and taps a fire button to try and hit the duck.
     <br>
      The app also keeps score of the amount of times you hit the duck.
