      In this project we learned the basic movements of a robot and the logic used in Comp Sci.

      In our scratch game you are trying to avoid bullets. You have 3 lives and a timer keeps track of your time. 
      <br>
      The bullets spawn randomly throughout the grid.

      In this project we took blocks of code and created a playable app. For me and my partners app, we created a Duck Hunter game. In the
      <br>
      game a duck randomly moves on a plain and the player drags a tank with a drag bar and taps a fire button to try and hit the duck.
     <br>
      The app also keeps score of the amount of times you hit the duck.

      Our next project was to create a game of life scenerio. The game takes you through your life giving you options to do 
      <br>
      different things and make different choices.

      In this simulation we changed the direction that the person is 
      <br>
      walking and what color the flowers are. We did this by editing 
      <br>
      the code and changing the colors in the lines of code that 
      <br>
      generated the flowers. Then we changed the persons direction
      <br>
      by making him spawn at 180 degrees instead of 90 degrees.
